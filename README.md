## Description

This HTML file creates a simple visual effect where two cells alternate their background colors between red and white, creating a visual blinking effect.

## Key Features

- **Table Structure:** A simple HTML table is used to organize the two cells.
- **CSS Styling:** Basic CSS styles the cells to create a grid-like appearance.
- **JavaScript Function:** A JavaScript function named `colors()` handles the color-changing logic.

## Functionality

1. **Initial State:**
   - The page loads with two empty cells, each with a 1px border.
   - The first cell is initially set to red, and the `colors()` function is called to start the animation.
2. **Color Alternation:**
   - The `colors()` function:
     - Retrieves references to the two cell elements.
     - Checks the current background color of the first cell:
       - If it's red, sets the first cell to white and the second cell to red.
       - If it's white, sets the first cell to red and the second cell to white.
     - Calls itself again after a 1-second delay using `setTimeout`, creating a continuous loop.

## File Structure

- `index.html` 

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The cells will automatically start alternating colors, creating the blinking effect.
